made a new Sudoku project
I have been working on Genetic algorithm to use it for my sudoku game. 
It fascinates me how nature works based on codes and algorithms.
This algorithm works based on mutation and selection and i believe that is how this planet evolves. 
Please if you like to know more about this algorithm check this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm#Genetic_operators


Sudoku game is 9x9 game evolves around 81 numbers from 1 to 9.
Each row has 1 to 9 numbers without any repetition.
Each column has 1 to 9 numbers without any repetition and each 3 X 3 box also has only 1 to 9 numbers.
